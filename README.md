===========================
Elite is a PoS-based cryptocurrency focused on providing services to the gaming community.


Elite Development Process
===========================
Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of Elite.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.
